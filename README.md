# browser-dice
In-browser dice game.
Object of the game:
    Each player will roll dice trying to reach a score of 100.
    If 1 is rolled the active player will lose current points and the next player has a turn.
    At any point in your turn, you can hold points, which will set your score and ending your turn.
    Failing to 'hold' and rolling '1' will not save points for the current round. First player to 100 wins
